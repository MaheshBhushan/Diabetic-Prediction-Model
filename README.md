# Diabetic Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## Description
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health-related features, such as glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), age, and other relevant factors.
## Result
The SVM model demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. By leveraging various health-related features, the model provides valuable insights into the diabetic status, aiding in early identification, monitoring, and intervention strategies for individuals at risk of diabetes.
