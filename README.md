# Diabetic Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## Description
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health-related features, such as glucose levels, body mass index (BMI), age, and other relevant factors.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab(Recommended)
- numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit Learn
